My approach: I approach this assignment not fully sure how I would achieve my goal. As bad as that sounds, I say this because I had troubles trying to access my api early on in the project.
However, once I learned how to access it and better understand how ajax and express interact, I was able to do a large amount of the work in a short amount of time.
   
I wanted to have the user be able to access the search functionality by default, and get access to their search history if they wanted to see their past searches.
